### What is OpenDollar

OpenDollar (OD) is a new type of cryptocurrency, built on the basis of Ethereum Smart Contracts technology.

This suggests creating financial value without any financial investments. It offers maximum convenience, maximum security and involves no bureaucracy.

OD is created in the amount of 50 billion units which are held by our team. Anyone can review the contract of the currency via link

### What is our goal

The OpenDollar team aim is to create a total capitalization amounting to over 50 billion US dollars. Such business valuation is possible, based on the planned gaining of 1 billion users, and assumed upon the market value of a user in the amount of $ 50. Due to our commitment in the creation of a large number of services that will be served by OpenDollar, the team is confident that the actual capitalization of the entire ecosystem will be much bigger. But, in any case, when the total number users of the ecosystem reach 1 billion users, we committed to an exchange rate of 1 OD equals to 1 US dollar. Thus, those people who share our confidence in the success of the Project, in fact become part of our team and our co-shareholders, due to the OD accumulation on his/her personal account using only own social connections and doing different activities inside of OD ecosystem.

### What we develop

The team develops a portfolio of products and services targeting global markets. OD will be used as an exclusive token for it. The first product we are going to launch with integrated OD is a messenger. Any user will get OD for referrals and marketing/social activity. More he uses and promotes the product - more OD he will get. Having it users can transfer between each other, convert to BTC/fiat or spend it for premium features we will offer.

### Distribution model

The distribution model of OD units is the following:
- marketing activity by users takes 22.22 bln OD
- referrals 22,22 bln OD
- 5.56 bln OD for development of the products by the team.

The success of the project depends on everyone and is shared by everyone involved in it.

OpenDollar will be exchanging at pre-determined fixed rate. The rate is gradually increased as we get closer to the goal (a number of users in the ecosystem). It will be calculated on the basis of dividing the total amount of users per billion.

1k users,         1 OD = 0.000001$

10k users,         1 OD = 0.00001$

100k users,         1 OD = 0.0001$

1mln users,          1 OD = 0.001$

10mln users,          1 OD = 0.01$

100mln users,          1 OD = 0.1$

1bln users,              1 OD = 1$

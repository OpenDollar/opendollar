### What is OpenDollar

OpenDollar (OD) is a new type of cryptocurrency, built using Ethereum Smart Contracts technology. The project intends to support social & non-profit fundraising initiatives and has very ambitious goals.

OD is created in the amount of 25 bln units and kept by the team. Anyone can review the contract of the currency by this address [0xba3e14a7f0169d86fc1389ad40ca4356a1404640](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba3e14a7f0169d86fc1389ad40ca4356a1404640). Anyone is free to use, exchange and transfer any number of OD.

### Distribution model

The distribution model is going to be next,
- Referrals and marketing activity by users - 50 %
- Social & non-profit fundraising initiatives - 40 %
- Support of the market price and liquidity by the team - 10%.

### What is our goal

We have the ambitious plan to archive 1 billion users in our ecosystem providing unique products and services. More people join our network - more value the network have. More value we have therefore it makes higher the price of OD at the market. The team believes in the project and exchanges OD to BTC/Fiat at fixed rate. The rate is going higher - more close we are to the goal (a number of users in the ecosystem). Think about it as a partnership, we develop the community together with users and share the value of the network with them by paying for it.

### Who is the team

A group of people around the world, which has claimed responsibility for the development of a wealthy and successful society. We want to create an environment in which we live comfortably. The main priorities for us - the interaction with the same kind of people and our prosperity. We are open and we have nothing to hide.

### What we develop

The team develops a portfolio of products and services targeting global markets. OD will be used as an exclusive token for it. The first product we are going to launch with integrated OD is a messenger. Any user will get OD for referrals and marketing/social activity. More he uses and promotes the product - more OD he will get. Having it users can transfer between each other, convert to BTC/fiat or spend it for premium features we will offer.
